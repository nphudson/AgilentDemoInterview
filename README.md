Demo Dashboard for Agilent Interview  
  
This repository is for a demo dashboard site that I made for Agilent Technologies, Inc. leading up to an interview in order to learn and show skills in HTML.  
I used a Bootstrap theme and modified it to fit my own needs. I created different pages that all link to each other, a notification bell with popup, etc. More description is available on the "Materials" page of the site.
